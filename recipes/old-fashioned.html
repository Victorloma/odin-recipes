                <ul>1,5 teaspoon of sugar</ul>
                <ul>1,5 teaspoon of water</ul>

                <ul>1 big ice cube</ul>
                <ul>1 slice of orange peel</ul>
            </li>
    <h3 class="left">How to make this delicous beverage:</h3>
        <li class="left">
            <ol><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add the sugar and the water into a wiskey glass.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir the sugar and water in the glass until all the sugar dissolves in the water.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the bourbon to the glass.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then add 3 dashes of Angostura bitters.</ol>
            <ol><strong>step 5:</strong> Now the big ice cube can be added aswell.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Step 6:</strong> Stir the drink until it becomes ice cold and a little diluted.</ol>
            <ol><strong>Step 7:</strong> The finishing touch consists of squeezing the oil out of the orange peel over the drink, so it gets an orange smell to it. You can also squeeze and rub the peel around the border of the glass for a more intense sensation.</ol>
